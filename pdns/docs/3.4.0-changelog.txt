DNSSEC changes:
gbba8413: add option (max-signature-cache-entries) to limit the maximum number of cached signatures.
g28b66a9: limit the number of NSEC3 iterations (see RFC5155 10.3), with the max-nsec3-iterations option.
gb50efd6: drop the 'superfluous NSEC3' option that old BIND validators need.
The bindbackend 'hybrid' mode was reintroduced by Kees Monshouwer. Enable it with bind-hybrid.
Aki Tuomi contributed experimental PKCS#11 support for DNSSEC key management with a (Soft)HSM.
Direct RRSIG queries now return NOTIMP.
gfa37777: add secure-all-zones command to pdnssec
Unrectified zones can now get rectified 'on the fly' during outgoing AXFR. This makes it possible to run a hidden signing master without rectification. Disable with disable-axfr-rectify.
g82fb538: AXFR in: don't accept zones with a mixture of Opt-Out NSEC3 RRs and non-Opt-Out NSEC3 RRs
Various minor bugfixes, mostly from the unstoppable Kees Monshouwer.
g0c4c552: set non-zero exit status in pdnssec if an exception was thrown, for easier automatic usage.
gb8bd119: pdnssec -v show-zone: Print all keys instead of just entry point keys.

New features:
DNAME support. Enable with experimental-dname-processing.
PowerDNS can now send stats directly to Carbon servers. Enable with carbon-server, tweak with carbon-ourname and carbon-interval.
g767da1a: Add list-zone capability to pdns_control
g51f6bca: Add delete-zone to pdnssec.
The gsql backends now support record comments, and disabling records. 

Bugfixes:
We now verify the algorithm used for TSIG queries, and use the right algorithm in signing if there is possible confusion.
gff99a74: making *-threads settings empty now yields a default of one instead of zero.
g9215e60: we had a deadly embrace in getUpdatedMasters in bindbackend reimplementation, thanks to Winfried for detailed debugging!
g9245fd9: don't addSuckRequest after supermaster zone creation to avoid one cause of simultaneous AXFR for the same zone
g719f902: fix dual-stack superslave when multiple namservers share a ip
g33966bf: avoid address truncation in doNotifications
geac85b1: prevent duplicate slave notications caused by different ipv6 address formatting
g3c8a711: make notification queue ipv6 compatible
g0c13e45: make isMaster ip check more tolerant for different ipv6 notations
Various fixes for possible issues reported by Coverity Scan (gf17c93b, )

API changes:
The REST API was much improved and is nearing stability, thanks to Christian Hofstaedtler and others.
Mark Schouten at Tuxis contributed a zone importer.

Other changes:
Our tarballs and packages now include *.sql schema files for the SQL backends.
The webserver (including API) now has an ACL (webserver-allow-from).
Webserver (including API) is now powered by YaHTTP.
Various autotools usage improvements from Ruben Kerkhof.
The dist tarball is now bzip2-compressed instead of gzip.
Various remotebackend updates, including replacing curl with (included) yahttp.
Dynamic module loading is now allowed on Mac OS X.
The AXFR ACL (allow-axfr-ips) now defaults to 127.0.0.0/8,::1 instead of the whole world.
gba91c2f: remove unused gpgsql-socket option and document postgres socket usage
Improved support for Lua 5.2.
The edns-subnet option code is now fixed at 8, and the edns-subnet-option-numbers option has been removed.
geobackend now has very limited edns-subnet support - it will use the 'real' remote if available.
pipebackend ABI v4 adds the zone name to the AXFR command.
We now avoid getaddrinfo() as much as possible.
The packet cache now handles (forwarded) recursive answers better, including TTL aging and respecting allow-recursion.
gff5ba4f: pdns_server --help no longer exits with 1.
Mark Zealey contributed an experimental LMDB backend. Kees Monshouwer added experimental DNSSEC support to it. Thanks, both!
g81859ba: No longer attempt to answer questions coming in from port 0, reply would not reach them anyhow. Thanks to Niels Bakker and sid3windr for insight & debugging. Closes #844.
RCodes are now reported in text in various places, thanks Aki.
Kees Monshouwer set up automatic testing for the oracle and goracle backends, and fixed various issues in them.
Leftovers of previous support for Windows have been removed, thanks to Kees Monshouwer, Aki Tuomi.
Bundled PolarSSL has been upgraded to 1.3.2
PolarSSL replaced previously bundled implementations of AES (ge22d9b4) and SHA (g9101035)

g0478c54: Updated global PDNS log table with DROP and PASS values to return on the stack for passthrough. This allows for users issue a dontanswer type to drop and not process any unwanted queries. Updated the example script to reflect changes. Updated the pdns.xml to reflect changes
gae7e77a: test to allow all lua steps to instruct powerdns not to answer a question
g49e8d5d: remove 'anonymous' mode from server.id and 'disabled' mode from version.bind

gee79512: ok, so it turns out that poll, select and a few other system calls can return EINTR when we receive and interrupt, and we need to manually restart. man 7 signal makes for good reading on this case, as does http://blog.reverberate.org/2011/04/eintr-and-pc-loser-ing-is-better-case.html
gaf7be19: don't skip remotebackend unix tests
g5683052: Remove AnswerData.created time field as it doesn't seem to be referenced anywhere and the time() call seems to take about 1-2% of process time under high load.
g66cea63: Merge branch 'master' into split-distributor
g268447b: Remove AnswerData.created time field as it doesn't seem to be referenced anywhere and the time() call seems to take about 1-2% of process time under high load.
g3194f0d: On testing with large numbers of unknown domains the send-root-referral argument query amounted to quite a high proportion of CPU time. This will cache it to reduce this overhead as is already done with a number of variables.

ge02f7b8: fix error in test description
g0ab3fdc: SRV record can have a '.' as final field, from which we would dutifully strip the trailing ., leaving void, confusing everything. We now remove the trailing . in the right place, and not if we are trying to server '.'. Again thanks to Jelte & SIDN for catching this.
g74fcdf4: implement RKEY record type. No regression test since none have ever been spotted in the wild, so we don't know what to compare against.

g99f95bd: correctly refuse out-of-zone data in bindbackend, closes #845
gce19a81: CHANGES BEHAVIOUR: before we launch, check if we can connect to the controlsocket we are about to obliterate. If it works, abort. Fixes #841 and changes standing behaviour. There might be circumstances where PowerDNS now refuses to start, where it previously would. However, starting and making our previous instance mute wasn't good.
g7dc2255: Initialize d_result to NULL on ctor
g5bc3abe: initialise server-id after all parsing is done, instead of half way through. Fixes situations where server-id was emptied explicitly. Reported by Wouter de Jong
g4d22050: bump boost requirement, thanks Wouter de Jong
