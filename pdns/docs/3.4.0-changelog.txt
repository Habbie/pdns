gf3799c1: Merge branch 'master' of github.com:PowerDNS/pdns
gbc9e03a: dnsreplay had odd race conditions in sending/reseinding packets We had logic to pre-read the first packet for better error reporting, and then not read it at the top of the while loop, but process the pre-read packet. However, this logic kept engaging, causing us to retransmit the previous packet a lot, depending on the size of our retransmit window, which in turn depended on the receiver characteristic. Horrible. dnsreplay may previously have overstated the number of duplicate packets because of this.

g0ab3fdc: SRV record can have a '.' as final field, from which we would dutifully strip the trailing ., leaving void, confusing everything. We now remove the trailing . in the right place, and not if we are trying to server '.'. Again thanks to Jelte & SIDN for catching this.
g74fcdf4: implement RKEY record type. No regression test since none have ever been spotted in the wild, so we don't know what to compare against.

g99f95bd: correctly refuse out-of-zone data in bindbackend, closes #845
gce19a81: CHANGES BEHAVIOUR: before we launch, check if we can connect to the controlsocket we are about to obliterate. If it works, abort. Fixes #841 and changes standing behaviour. There might be circumstances where PowerDNS now refuses to start, where it previously would. However, starting and making our previous instance mute wasn't good.
g7dc2255: Initialize d_result to NULL on ctor
g5bc3abe: initialise server-id after all parsing is done, instead of half way through. Fixes situations where server-id was emptied explicitly. Reported by Wouter de Jong
g4d22050: bump boost requirement, thanks Wouter de Jong
